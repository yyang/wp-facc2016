#Description#

###FACC 2016###

We have forked and optimized Unite theme for [Fundamentals and Applications of Cerium Dioxide in Catalysis 2016](http://www.chem.pku.edu.cn/facc2016), a catalysis related symposium.

Optimization includes borrowing Material UI colors and other open source fonts, since Google Webfonts are not available in PR China.

###Unite###

Unite is a clean, modern and fully responsive WordPress wedding theme built using Bootstrap 3 which makes it optimized for tablets and mobile. It is a highly customizable theme with unlimited color variations that can be tweaked via simple yet powerful Theme Options. Theme has a built-in Popular Posts Widget, Infinite Scroll (powered by Jatpack) and translation support. It's now available in German and French. Theme features fancy image slider, SEO friendly structure, logo support, social links and widgetized homepage.  This theme was built to be used for wedding related websites but can be tweaked to be used as any other image-centric blog such as travel. Unite theme now supports WooCommerce to create your own eStore.

#Installation#

You may download the file, unzip it and move the unzipped contents to the "wp-content/themes" folder of your WordPress installation. You will then be able to activate the theme.

Right after you activate FACC 2016, you'll see message on top of your screen, asking you to install CPT Bootstrap Carousel (optional). Make sure you install and activate it if you want to setup image slider just like on theme demo.

If you dismiss this notice, you can install this plugin later via Appearance->Install plugins.
